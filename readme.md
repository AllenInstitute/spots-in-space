# Spatial Analysis Working Group
This repo is a home for analysis of spatial transcriptomics data, initially focused on Brain Science data and analysis.

## Example Topics:
1. Cell Type Mapping:
  - Methods to identify the transcriptomic types of spatial transcriptomics cells
  - Incorporation of spatial information into cell type mapping
  - Incorporation of cell type identities into cell segmentation
2. Data Formatting and Handling
  - Desirable formats for downstream processing and visualization
  - standardization across experiments, outside the Institute, etc.
3. Data Visualization
  - Internal tools and research-grade visualization
  - External/"Product" visualizations
  - Data summary
