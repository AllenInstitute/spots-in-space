# Cell Type Mapping 
## Background:
1. Problem Statement
2. scRNASeq precedents

## Characteristics of Spatial Transcriptomics Data
1. number of genes
2. types of noise
3. dynamic range
4. differences from single-cell and single-nucleus RNASeq

## Computational Approaches
1. find the closest scRNASeq cluster for each cell
3. cluster spatial data _de novo_ and find the closest scRNASeq cluster/annotation for each of the new clusters
