Two cells were considered contacting if their nucleus centroids were within 15 μm in the imaging plane, which is approximately the size of the cell body of a single neuron. Contact frequency between any two cell types was determined as the observed frequency. Then, spatial localization of each cell was randomized within a radius of 50 μm, unless otherwise mentioned. Expected contact frequency between any two cell types was determined in each permutation and such permutation was performed 1,000 times to obtain the distribution of expected contact frequencies. The significance of observed contact frequency was calculated using one-tailed z-test and P-values were corrected to FDR (false discovery rate) using Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure. \n",
